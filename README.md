# MyCloneRoyal

This project was written in C# and it was created in some kind of 24hour challenge. Which is also why some of the game code seems scrapy. There was not a lot of time for this project, but it shows my first experiences with Network code and also more experience with non Unity C#.

To test I recommend to compile it into an exe if you want to recompile. And then just opening 2 instances of the program.
Connects with connect to server.

The server is ready by default so to start the game all the player2 needs to do is click on ready. The rest is gameplay.


Player1 has the left and Player2 has the right side. 

Units are placed with left click and move towards the enemy side.
There are 3 types of units. The normal unit the sniper unit and the tank unit. Each has a different energy cost and different range, health, movementspeed and damage values. 
The one that gets the others health to 0 wins. I think the rest is self explanatory. If you have any questions text me.
